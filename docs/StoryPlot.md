Long time ago, goddess was walking along humans, living on the Vakoh, a floating island with a worshipping people, the Guardians while the other humans stayed living below. Granting them favor for their fidelity, they wanted to keep this people by their side. To do so, they shackled their soul into their body in order for them to not be able to die and called them Guardians of Vakoh, with the hope of the guardians worshipping them forever.
But the goddesses didn't bother ask the permission to do such thing, which irritated some of their followers, whom centuries after centuries living, felt the feeling of wanting more. The Goddesses accepted granting a favor to them, and decided to land Vakoh, the holy island, in the great sea, in order to let the Guardians live aside with the other normal humans.
Centuries passed, and the irritation of some Guardians towards their immortality progressed into hatred. Living side by side with their humans peer made them realize how lonely they were. Seeing loved one leave while they felt trapped on earth. They started calling their divine gift a curse. They asked the goddess to release the soul bounding spell. The Goddess refused as they grew attached to all of their followers. The fidel Guardians didn't approve and forgive such a disrespectful request and decided to exile them, and renamed them Renegades.  
Having to quit the holy island and their goddess protection, they decided to continue living with the humans. 

A pact is made, the Guardians returned in the holy island and shared some of their knowledge about souls given by the Goddess in order to quench the greed of the humans.
The Renegades taken as responsible of the war and departure of the Goddess, didn't have the right to go back to Vakoh and had to live further in the mountains, still looking for a way to release themselves from their own bodies.

## Improvements [14/06/2020] : Andrea & Quentin > Online Meeting

### Game play

* having tactical view and on tactical and classical view.
  * Having a little screen above that show the owned characters and highlight the ones that has to take their turns.
  * Having the order list of action (in tactical of the selected side, in the classical of the current side)
  * in tactical : Having a listing view of all friendly characters (to be able to select them to go in the classical view of their side or just get health/mp information for healers)
* Having a mapping between hexagon sides and in-world sides. (make it possible for eccentric setup).
* Ambush is a state in which you enter a fight and the enemies can hit you from an adjacent side. (in term of UI, during an attack an ambushers appear the time of the attack and disappear)
* Encounter wise (trails in the sky like system)
* Having a log of actions only in classical view (would be a mess in tactical)
* Being able to play the turn of a character wherever he is in any view mode (if target required having a popup-like window to select target).

### Story wise

* The Renegades are the same (wants to become mortal). But the initial start of their rebellion was caused by the Goddesses deciding to send off SOME immortals to a a "greater place". But some of them stayed for centuries without having the ascension. Making them rebel against the goddess, making them leave. Which made the flying island of Vakoh fall off from the sky to the Ocean. And that is why they got excused by the immortals to become renegades.
* The renegades, not being able to be ascended anymore, wants to find death to go to the "greater" place humans claims to go when they die.
* The Immortals are extremist (mostly) that wants to convert people to their religious thought in order to make the Goddesses come back and discover ascension (which is impossible now that the goddess left).
* Humans follow their greed to get the secret of immortality by experimenting on souls and improving their science.
* Focus on the maelstrom as ariana line for the story.
* Reminder : The maelstrom happened at the closest place human can reach by foot to the Vakoh island. It's the place the biggest garrison of the human army was standing. Making their number, after the incident, decrease too much to continue to fight. Signing the peace. 
* Maelstrom has been created because of a "failed" human experimentation (maybe wrong ?) which impacted how the souls interact in Amerite, making them physically manipulable by anyone. Strangely the monsters/creatures got angrier and more aggressive following this event.
* Maelstrom is actually a gate to a parallel plane that is feeding itself on Amerite.
* The Governor of Sylbrite is possessed by __an entity__ from that world, making him looking like a good guy fighting for the peace between races and factions.
* The Governor of Sylbrite is manipulating the world in order to enter in a war (getting more souls to feed to his homeland)
* The story of each factions starts (following a story telling in each capitals) by a tournament organised by the Governor of Sylbrite having for main official purpose to celebrate the 50 years of peace after the great war.
Actually the factions takes it as an opportunity to show off the power that they still have in case of a re-start of hostility. The governor is using it to create tensions (TODO idea still has to be dug on) between the factions.
* End Game idea : The war cannot be stopped in time, but still a fight occurs to dethrone the Governor (en fight). But still, because mmorpg never dies, the two world merge making a new land to explore and more actual enemies conflicting with Amerite.

* For foreshadowing purpose : humans Souls, when they die, are actually sent over the other plane in order to be reincarnated. And the "Ascension" of the immortals is actually a manual sending made by the goddess to go into this other plane (funny enough the Renegades where right to want to die). TODO Idea still has to be dug on

* The renegades doesn't hold a grudge against the Immortals as they don't care about being a noble in Vakoh but just want to free themselves from earthly shackles.
* The chief of the renegades is a famous warrior ( the most ancient and powerful immortals ) that stopped the bloody battle of Rigs with his power alone. Making him a symbol of peace and power to the citizen of any race in the world.
* The researcher is the reason why humans and renegades can't be all friendly (torture and in-human experimentation made to find out the secret of immortality).
* The researcher "The einstein of Amerite" is the cause of the maelstrom incident, it was not an accident as he was trying to prove his theory of another plane was true. The experiment actually was a success.
* Idea This guy could be the entity that possessed the Governor, TODO need to find a reason why.

* Idea : Maybe having the immortals being a perfect democracy, where every voice count (and actually count) and the respect between each other (in the same species) is absolute. Making it the "Teddy Bear" of the world (so the target), it is a closed country, having strong resent toward human realm. But a party (the church one) is defending from the outside the most they can.
