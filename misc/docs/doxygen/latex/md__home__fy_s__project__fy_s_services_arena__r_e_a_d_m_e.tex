\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Create the internal (interprocess) zmq communication channel (even without threading pool) to read from the Fighting\+Pit
\item Implement a first fighting version without multiple without multiple battles.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make one Arena Worker by default.
\item Implement chai scripting
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Minimum script call possible in a first place. Monster will have their script fully loaded and have a \char`\"{}execute\+Action\char`\"{} function that will be called from the cpp
\item Players will have to launch chai script to execute actions (no c++ hard coded action)
\item Each chai scripts need to be tested unitarly by a cpp test case which has to be developped in a way that it will be reusable.
\item When scripting are done and tested, create a repository to store those scripts (and all the upcoming ones). And link them to the repository FyS via a submodule.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Check if it is faster to return a cpp function from chaiscript and execute it compared to executing the code in chaiscript.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Unit test the fighting mechanism with mocked scripting
\item Test external authentication/implement messaging of notifications to players
\item Implement thread pool into each worker to enable multiple fighting\+Pit per service
